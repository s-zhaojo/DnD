MoodRoll - React App
MoodRoll is a fun and interactive app that lets users roll a virtual dice to select a YouTube video based on their mood. The app offers a variety of mood categories such as Happy, Mad, and Sad, with corresponding music videos from YouTube. It features an immersive background animation powered by Spline.
